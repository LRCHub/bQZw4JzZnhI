Heads or tails, what will it be?
Take your choice, him or me!
Heads or tails, you'll have to choose
Heads you win, tails you lose

Flip the coin, take a chance
Loves a game called romance
East come and easy go
Its your turn, and i've got to know!

Cheating woman, place your bet
What you see is what you get
East come and easy go
Its your turn, and i've got to know!
