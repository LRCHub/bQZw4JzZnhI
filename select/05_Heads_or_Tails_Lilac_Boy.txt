Desert day reaper
Reaps the crops and withers
This was the blight of the farmer
This was what living was like

Heads or Tails
Will I die today
Heads or Tails
Will I starve today
Heads or Tails
Will it rain today
Heads or Tails
Will I die today
Heads or Tails
Will it even get likes
Heads or Tails
Does anyone like me
Heads or Tails
No phone reception
Heads or Tails
I'm sick of this world

Severe cold in the winter
Not much time to blither
This was the blight of the worker
This was what living was like

Heads or Tails
Will I die today
Heads or Tails
Will I starve today
Heads or Tails
Will it rain today
Heads or Tails
Will I die today
Heads or Tails
Will it even get likes
Heads or Tails
Does anyone like me
Heads or Tails
No phone reception
Heads or Tails
I'm sick of this world
