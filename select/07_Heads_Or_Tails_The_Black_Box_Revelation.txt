No place to hide away
Better be noble and get things straight
Set the rules
Rate your risk
Think before you place your bet

Be my ally or my enemy
We'll play it hard, no in between
Cut the line - let me drown
Hail the queen- I'll wear your crown

I close my eyes
As you flip the coin
Heads, I win your heart for one more night
Tails means goodbye
Before it hits the floor
I'm not quite sure what I wished for

Double or nothing
Joker's wild
Diamond Jim
Got a two-bit smile
Something's hounding in my head
But I can't tell if it's black or red

I close my eyes
(As) you flip the coin
Heads, I win your heart for one more night
Tails means goodbye
Before it hits the floor
I'm not quite sure what I wished for

Do we really need to take this chance
Comin in and out of this romance
Should we leave it all to circumstance?
Dare you look, throw a glance
