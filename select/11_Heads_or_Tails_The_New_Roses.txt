Well I'm down, I'm out, I'm broke, I'm damned
And I'm not getting any younger
Well I'm covered in mud and
I'm coughing blood
In the streets I hear broken thunder
And it makes me wonder

Is it good, is it bad, is it brave or sad
Will I ever get credit for this
Am I blessed or cursed, is my universe
Drowning in lukewarm piss
I rather not reminisce

Oh heads lose tails win
Take it on the chin, take it on the chin
Tails win heads lose
There are biased coins in use
And that's the brutal truth

Well I'm high, I'm in, I'm rich, I'm a saint
And I'm not getting any stronger
And I kick the past in its winy ass
And walk out on a stage to conquer
I can't wait any longer

Fuck that noise, I got no choice
So I grab what I can get
Well I'm a hot wire and I'm spitting fire
Trying to remember what I'm trying to forget
Sometimes it drives me mad

Oh heads lose tails win
Take it on the chin, take it on the chin
Tails win heads lose
There are biased coins in use
And that's the brutal truth

Oh heads lose tails win
Take it on the chin, take it on the chin
Tails win heads lose
There are biased coins in use
And that's the brutal truth
The brutal truth
The brutal truth
