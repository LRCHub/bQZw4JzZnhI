[00:09.77] Rolling with the punches Changing one's tune
[00:13.50] Those who can't do it—game over.
[00:17.15] What was white yesterday is black today
[00:20.69] The speed of the times fluctuates wildly
[00:24.79] Right turn, right turn Hand in hand Picking on each other's mistakes
[00:28.39] Right brain, left brain Running around in circles Is that the proper way to do things?
[00:32.16] Trivial slander Before you know it, it's serious The ironic pull
[00:35.34] Do you know how that tragedy ended?
[00:40.57] Life is like a real-life game of make-believe.
[00:44.23] Disposable Justice (Everyone's acting)
[00:47.68] Even in this world Where we fight for a place to belong
[00:51.51] "There's something I want to believe in..."
[00:55.00] But doubt it (Well then, I'll take this)
[00:58.78] I lose myself (as I'm swept away)
[01:02.34] I will not be a pitiful king
[01:06.22] Get careless and you'll get a bad ending
[01:17.22] The "Happiness" of a formal face Dancing timeline
[01:21.34] I know... it's full of comparisons.
[01:25.07] Suddenly, my reflection appeared on the screen—mirrored left and right.
[01:28.48] Like a stranger "Who are you?"
[01:32.63] You keep lamenting while wanting something different from others.
[01:36.33] Feeling uneasy and restless when different from others—a contradiction
[01:40.00] You can't settle things with just what's right That "excess" kind of self
[01:43.17] Holding it close, I breathe
[01:48.15] Taming my stubborn self
[01:51.97] Pretending to be normal (Everyone's alive)
[01:55.44] Surrounded by nothing but correct answers in this modern age I struggle onward, walking through it
[02:02.79] Sometimes we fight (and realize our sorrow)
[02:06.51] Stay close to me (and realize love)
[02:10.10] Everyone does it that way (repeating it)
[02:13.84] Waiting for a happy ending
[02:32.24] Just live your life, okay? Even if you're full of complaints
[02:36.56] (No way, that's impossible. That's too much. I'm just venting.)
[02:39.75] Scattering dust as it races by, Like a comet
[02:43.75] (Consuming unnecessary emotions, burning them up—that's how it goes)
[02:47.16] It's shining
[02:49.57] Guilty or not, it's all up to the times. That's how it goes, everything and anything.
[02:53.19] Lie? Cry? Alright! A dark future Swallow it all whole
[02:56.85] Love and sorrow, pleasure and pain, everything—burn it all away.
[03:00.08] In the darkness, I want to burst into a flash
[03:06.81] Life is like a real-life game of make-believe.
[03:10.78] Disposable Justice (Everyone's acting)
[03:14.28] Even in this world Where we fight for a place to belong
[03:18.13] "There's something I want to believe in..."
[03:21.52] But doubt it (Well then, I'll take this)
[03:25.36] I lose myself (as I'm swept away)
[03:29.04] I will not be a pitiful king
[03:32.64] Get careless and you'll get a bad ending
